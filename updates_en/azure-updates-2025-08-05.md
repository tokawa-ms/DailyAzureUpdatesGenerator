**Details**:

The recent general availability of DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) for Azure DNS Public Zones in the US Government and China regions marks a significant enhancement in the security posture of Azure’s DNS service in these sovereign clouds. DNSSEC is a suite of extensions to DNS that provides cryptographic authentication of DNS data, protecting against common DNS attacks such as cache poisoning and spoofing by ensuring the integrity and origin of DNS responses.

**Background and Purpose:**  
DNS, as a foundational internet service, is vulnerable to various attacks that can redirect users to malicious sites or intercept sensitive data. DNSSEC addresses these vulnerabilities by digitally signing DNS records, enabling resolvers to verify that the data has not been tampered with. While Azure DNS has supported DNSSEC in global regions, this update extends that critical security feature to Azure’s US Gov and China regions, which serve government and regulated customers with stringent compliance requirements. This expansion ensures that customers operating in these regions can now secure their public DNS zones with DNSSEC, aligning with best practices for DNS security and regulatory mandates.

**Specific Features and Detailed Changes:**  
With this update, customers can enable DNSSEC on both new and existing Azure DNS Public Zones in the US Gov and China regions. The feature supports the full DNSSEC chain of trust, including automatic key management and signing of DNS records. Azure DNS handles the generation, rollover, and publication of cryptographic keys (KSK and ZSK), simplifying operational overhead. The service also publishes DS (Delegation Signer) records to the parent zone, facilitating chain of trust validation by DNS resolvers. The integration is seamless, requiring minimal configuration changes from users beyond enabling DNSSEC on their zones.

**Technical Mechanisms and Implementation Methods:**  
Azure DNS implements DNSSEC using standard algorithms and key sizes compliant with IETF RFCs (such as RFC 4033, 4034, and 4035). When DNSSEC is enabled on a public zone, Azure DNS generates a Key Signing Key (KSK) and a Zone Signing Key (ZSK). The ZSK signs the DNS records, while the KSK signs the DNSKEY record set. Azure DNS automates key rollovers to maintain security without service disruption. The DS record, which contains a hash of the KSK, is published to the parent zone (e.g., the TLD), enabling resolvers to validate the chain of trust from the root down to the zone. This automation reduces the complexity traditionally associated with DNSSEC deployment.

**Use Cases and Application Scenarios:**  
This update is particularly relevant for government agencies, regulated industries, and enterprises operating in US Gov and China regions that require enhanced DNS security to comply with regulatory standards such as FedRAMP, CJIS, or China’s cybersecurity laws. Use cases include securing public-facing services such as government portals, critical infrastructure endpoints, and any public DNS zones that require protection against DNS spoofing and cache poisoning attacks. Organizations can now confidently deploy DNSSEC to protect their domain name resolution integrity, thereby improving overall security posture and trustworthiness.

**Important Considerations and Limitations:**  
While DNSSEC significantly enhances DNS security, it requires that DNS resolvers querying the zones support DNSSEC validation; otherwise, the benefits are not realized. Customers should verify that their clients and upstream resolvers validate DNSSEC signatures. Additionally, enabling DNSSEC may slightly increase DNS response sizes due to the inclusion of cryptographic signatures, which could impact some legacy network devices or firewalls with strict packet size limits. Careful monitoring during rollout is advised. Also, DNSSEC does not encrypt DNS queries or responses; it only provides data integrity and authenticity.

**Integration with Related Azure Services:**  
Azure DNS with DNSSEC integrates seamlessly with Azure Traffic Manager, Azure Front Door, and Azure CDN, ensuring that DNS queries for endpoints managed by these services benefit from DNSSEC protection. Furthermore, customers using Azure Policy can enforce DNSSEC enablement on Azure DNS zones for governance. Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center can be used to track
