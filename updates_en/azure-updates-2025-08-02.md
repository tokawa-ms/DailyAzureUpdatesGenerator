For more details, visit: https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=499192

**Details**:

The recent Azure Backup update announces the general availability of agentless multi-disk crash consistent backups for Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), enabling IT professionals to perform comprehensive VM backups without installing any backup agents inside the VM. This enhancement addresses the need for simplified, reliable, and scalable backup solutions for multi-disk Azure VMs, particularly in environments where agent installation is impractical or undesired.

**Background and Purpose:**  
Traditionally, Azure VM backups relied on either agent-based or snapshot-based approaches. Agent-based backups require installation and management of backup agents inside each VM, which can increase operational overhead, complicate maintenance, and introduce potential compatibility issues. Snapshot-based backups, while agentless, often focused on single disk or OS disk backups, lacking comprehensive multi-disk consistency. The purpose of this update is to provide a fully agentless backup solution that ensures crash consistency across multiple attached data disks of a VM, simplifying backup management and improving reliability for complex VM configurations.

**Specific Features and Detailed Changes:**  
- **Agentless Backup:** No need to deploy or maintain backup agents inside the VM, reducing management complexity and potential security risks.  
- **Multi-Disk Support:** Supports crash consistent backups across all attached disks (OS and data disks) of a VM, ensuring data consistency across the entire VM storage.  
- **Crash Consistency:** Guarantees that the backup captures the VM state in a crash consistent manner, meaning the backup reflects the data as it would be after a sudden power loss or crash, which is suitable for many applications that do not require application-level consistency.  
- **General Availability (GA):** The feature has moved from preview to GA, indicating it is production-ready with full Microsoft support and SLAs.

**Technical Mechanisms and Implementation Methods:**  
The agentless multi-disk crash consistent backup leverages Azure’s underlying snapshot and storage infrastructure. It uses Azure’s native snapshot capabilities to capture the state of all attached managed disks simultaneously. The backup service coordinates the snapshot creation to ensure all disks are captured at the same point in time, preserving crash consistency. This is achieved without requiring any in-guest coordination or quiescing, relying on the VM’s storage stack and Azure platform to maintain consistency. The snapshots are then stored in the Recovery Services vault, enabling restore operations as needed.

**Use Cases and Application Scenarios:**  
- **Multi-Disk VMs:** VMs with multiple attached data disks, such as database servers, analytics workloads, or file servers, where consistent backup across all disks is critical.  
- **Agentless Environments:** Scenarios where installing backup agents is restricted due to security policies, compliance requirements, or operational constraints.  
- **Scale and Automation:** Large-scale environments where managing agents on numerous VMs is impractical, benefiting from simplified agentless backup management.  
- **Disaster Recovery and Compliance:** Organizations requiring reliable crash consistent backups for regulatory compliance or disaster recovery planning.

**Important Considerations and Limitations:**  
- **Crash Consistency vs. Application Consistency:** This backup method ensures crash consistency but does not guarantee application-level consistency. For workloads requiring application-consistent backups (e.g., databases with transaction logs), agent-based or application-aware backups may still be necessary.  
- **Supported VM Types and Disks:** The feature supports Azure managed disks attached to VMs; compatibility with certain VM sizes or disk types should be verified in the official documentation.  
- **Restore Granularity:** Restores are performed at the VM or disk level; file-level restores may require additional tools or processes.  
- **Performance Impact:** Snapshot operations are designed to be low-impact, but backup windows and performance should be monitored in high I/O environments.

**Integration with Related Azure Services:**  
- **Azure Recovery Services Vault:** The backups are stored and managed within Recovery Services vaults, leveraging existing Azure Backup infrastructure for retention, encryption, and recovery.  
- **Azure Policy and Automation:** Backup policies can be applied via Azure Policy
