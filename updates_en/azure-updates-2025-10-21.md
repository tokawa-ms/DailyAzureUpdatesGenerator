**Details**:

The recent Azure update introduces the Public Preview of sharing Capacity Reservation Groups (CRGs) across multiple subscriptions, enhancing flexibility in managing reserved compute capacity for Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). 

**Background and Purpose:**  
Capacity Reservations in Azure enable customers to reserve VM compute capacity in a specific Azure region to ensure availability during deployment, which is critical for workloads requiring guaranteed resources. Previously, CRGs were confined to a single subscription, limiting cross-subscription resource planning and utilization. This update addresses that limitation by allowing CRGs to be shared across subscriptions, facilitating centralized capacity management and optimized resource allocation in multi-subscription environments common in large enterprises or managed service providers.

**Specific Features and Detailed Changes:**  
- **Cross-subscription Sharing:** CRGs can now be shared with other Azure subscriptions within the same Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant. This means a CRG created in one subscription can be assigned to VMs deployed in different subscriptions.  
- **On-demand Capacity Reservation Groups:** The update supports on-demand CRGs, allowing dynamic reservation of capacity without long-term commitment, which can be shared similarly.  
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC):** Sharing leverages Azure RBAC to control which subscriptions and users have access to the shared CRGs, ensuring secure and governed capacity sharing.  
- **No Impact on Billing:** Reservations remain billed to the subscription that owns the CRG, simplifying cost management.

**Technical Mechanisms and Implementation Methods:**  
- CRGs are created in a subscription as usual via Azure Portal, CLI, or ARM templates.  
- To share a CRG, the owner subscription grants access to other subscriptions by configuring the sharing settings, typically through Azure Resource Manager policies or RBAC assignments.  
- VMs deployed in the subscriber subscription specify the shared CRG ID during creation or update, enabling them to consume the reserved capacity.  
- The underlying Azure Fabric Controller ensures that capacity is allocated according to the reservation regardless of subscription boundaries, maintaining isolation and performance guarantees.  
- The sharing feature requires all involved subscriptions to be under the same AAD tenant to maintain security and identity consistency.

**Use Cases and Application Scenarios:**  
- **Enterprise Multi-subscription Environments:** Large organizations often segment workloads across subscriptions for billing, compliance, or organizational reasons. Shared CRGs allow centralized capacity reservation management while enabling distributed VM deployments.  
- **Managed Service Providers (MSPs):** MSPs managing multiple customer subscriptions can reserve capacity centrally and share it across customer environments, optimizing utilization and reducing overhead.  
- **Dev/Test and Production Separation:** Teams can reserve capacity in a central subscription and share it with development, testing, or production subscriptions, ensuring resource availability without duplicating reservations.  
- **Burst Capacity Management:** On-demand CRGs shared across subscriptions allow flexible scaling during peak demand periods without long-term reservation commitments.

**Important Considerations and Limitations:**  
- Sharing is limited to subscriptions within the same Azure AD tenant; cross-tenant sharing is not supported.  
- The billing responsibility remains with the CRG owner subscription; subscribers consume capacity but do not incur reservation charges.  
- There may be quota and regional constraints on the number of CRGs and shared subscriptions.  
- VM sizes and regions must match the reservation specifications to utilize the shared capacity.  
- As this feature is in Public Preview, it may have limitations or changes before general availability; production workloads should be tested accordingly.

**Integration with Related Azure Services:**  
- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM):** ARM templates and policies facilitate automation of CRG creation and sharing configurations.  
- **Azure RBAC:** Ensures secure access control for shared CRGs across subscriptions.  
- **Azure Cost Management:** Billing remains centralized, but cost reports can be correlated across subscriptions to track reservation usage.  
- **Azure Monitor and Azure Advisor:** Can be used to monitor capacity utilization and optimize reservation usage across subscriptions.  
- **Azure DevOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Enables automated

**Details**:

The recent Azure update announces the general availability of two PowerShell scripts designed to enhance the migration process from Azure Application Gateway V1 SKUs (Standard or WAF) to V2 SKUs (Standard_V2 or WAF_V2). This update addresses the impending retirement of V1 SKUs by April 2026, encouraging early migration to leverage improved capabilities and maintain supported infrastructure.

**Background and Purpose:**  
Azure Application Gateway V1 SKUs have been foundational for web traffic load balancing and application delivery but lack certain advanced features and performance improvements introduced in V2 SKUs. Given Microsoft’s plan to retire V1 SKUs by April 2026, organizations must transition to V2 to ensure continued support, security updates, and access to enhanced features such as autoscaling, zone redundancy, and improved SSL offloading. The migration process, however, can be complex due to configuration differences and resource dependencies, especially concerning public IP addresses and custom settings. This update aims to simplify and automate key aspects of migration, reducing manual effort and minimizing downtime risks.

**Specific Features and Detailed Changes:**  
The update provides two PowerShell scripts:

1. **Enhanced Cloning Script:** This script automates the replication of an existing Application Gateway V1 configuration to a new V2 instance. It extracts settings such as listeners, backend pools, HTTP settings, routing rules, and WAF policies, then applies them to the V2 gateway, ensuring configuration parity.

2. **Public IP Retention Script:** A critical challenge during migration is retaining the existing public IP address associated with the V1 gateway to avoid DNS propagation delays and client disruption. This script facilitates the detachment of the public IP from the V1 gateway and re-association with the newly created V2 gateway, preserving IP continuity.

Both scripts are designed to be idempotent and include validation steps to verify successful configuration replication and IP reassignment.

**Technical Mechanisms and Implementation Methods:**  
The scripts leverage Azure PowerShell modules and REST APIs to programmatically query the existing V1 Application Gateway configuration and resource properties. They parse JSON representations of the gateway’s settings, transform them to align with V2 schema requirements, and deploy the new V2 gateway resources accordingly. The public IP retention script manages resource locks and dependencies to safely detach and reattach public IP resources without causing conflicts or orphaned resources. Error handling and logging are integrated to provide feedback during execution.

**Use Cases and Application Scenarios:**  
- Enterprises running production workloads on Application Gateway V1 needing a seamless upgrade path to V2.  
- Organizations requiring minimal downtime and IP address continuity during migration to avoid client impact.  
- Automation-focused teams integrating migration scripts into CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure as code (IaC) workflows.  
- Scenarios where WAF policies and custom routing rules must be preserved accurately in the new deployment.

**Important Considerations and Limitations:**  
- The scripts currently support migration from Standard and WAF V1 SKUs only to their respective V2 SKUs; cross-tier migrations or custom SKUs may require manual adjustments.  
- Some V1 features deprecated or changed in V2 may not be fully transferable; validation post-migration is essential.  
- The public IP retention script assumes the public IP is not in use by other resources and that resource locks do not prevent reassignment.  
- Users must have appropriate Azure RBAC permissions (Contributor or higher) on the Application Gateway and public IP resources.  
- Testing in non-production environments is recommended before executing in production to ensure compatibility with specific configurations.

**Integration with Related Azure Services:**  
- The migration scripts interact with Azure Resource Manager (ARM) for resource provisioning and configuration management.  
- Integration with Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center can be used post-migration to validate operational health and security posture of the new V2 gateway.  
- Works in conjunction with Azure DNS or external DNS services to maintain endpoint resolution continuity when public IPs are retained.  
- Can be incorporated into
