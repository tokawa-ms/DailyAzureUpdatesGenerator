**Link**: [Generally Available:  Azure Firewall now supports ingestion-time transformation in Log Analytics for flexible, cost-efficient logging](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=498568)

**Update ID**: 498568
**Data source**: Azure Updates API

**Categories**: Launched, Networking, Security, Azure Firewall, Features, Services

**Summary**:

- What was updated  
Azure Firewall now supports ingestion-time transformation of logs in Log Analytics.

- Key changes or new features  
This update enables selective logging and advanced filtering of firewall logs at ingestion time. By transforming logs as they are ingested into Log Analytics, customers can reduce the volume of data stored and analyzed, leading to more cost-efficient logging. This feature allows customization of which log data to retain, improving performance and lowering storage and ingestion costs without losing critical insights.

- Target audience affected  
Developers, IT professionals, and security teams who use Azure Firewall and rely on Log Analytics for monitoring, analysis, and auditing of firewall traffic and events.

- Important notes if any  
Implementing ingestion-time transformations requires configuration in Log Analytics workspace settings. Users should carefully design filters to ensure essential security data is retained. This capability helps optimize operational costs while maintaining visibility into firewall activity, making it especially valuable for large-scale deployments with high log volumes.

**Details**:

Certainly! Here is a comprehensive technical explanation of the Azure Firewall update regarding ingestion-time transformation in Log Analytics:

### Background and Purpose of the Update

Azure Firewall generates extensive logs capturing network traffic, threats, and application-level events. These logs are critical for security monitoring, compliance, and troubleshooting. Traditionally, all logs generated by Azure Firewall are ingested into Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspaces, where they can be queried and analyzed.

However, ingesting all raw logs without filtering or transformation can lead to high ingestion and storage costs, especially in large-scale environments with heavy traffic. Additionally, not all log data is equally valuable for every use case, and indiscriminate ingestion can overwhelm analytics with noise.

The purpose of this update is to provide **ingestion-time transformation** capabilities directly within Log Analytics for Azure Firewall logs. This allows customers to perform **selective logging and advanced filtering** *before* logs are ingested and stored, optimizing cost and improving data relevance.

### Specific Features and Detailed Changes

- **Ingestion-Time Transformation Support**: Azure Firewall now supports applying transformation rules at the point of ingestion into Log Analytics. This means logs can be filtered, enriched, or selectively routed based on defined criteria.

- **Selective Logging**: Users can specify which types of logs or events to ingest, filtering out unnecessary or low-value data.

- **Advanced Filtering**: Complex filtering logic can be applied to logs, such as filtering by IP addresses, protocols, threat severity, or other custom fields.

- **Cost Efficiency**: By reducing the volume of ingested data, customers can significantly lower ingestion and storage costs in Log Analytics.

- **Seamless Integration**: This capability is integrated into the Azure Firewall diagnostic settings and Log Analytics ingestion pipeline, requiring minimal configuration changes.

### Technical Mechanisms and Implementation Methods

- **Transformation Rules Configuration**: Users define transformation rules using Azure Monitorâ€™s ingestion-time transformation syntax, which supports filtering, field extraction, and record modification.

- **Diagnostic Settings Update**: In the Azure Firewall diagnostic settings, customers can now specify ingestion-time transformation policies that apply to the logs sent to Log Analytics.

- **Pipeline Processing**: When Azure Firewall emits logs, they are processed through the ingestion pipeline where the transformation rules are applied. Only logs matching the criteria are ingested.

- **Supported Log Types**: This feature currently supports all Azure Firewall log types, including Network Rule Logs, Application Rule Logs, and Threat Intelligence Logs.

- **No Impact on Raw Logs**: The original logs remain intact at the source; transformation only affects what is ingested into Log Analytics.

---

### Use Cases and Application Scenarios

- **Cost Optimization in Large Environments**: Enterprises with high-volume firewall traffic can reduce their Log Analytics ingestion costs by filtering out low-priority logs.

- **Focused Security Monitoring**: Security teams can ingest only high-severity threat logs or specific application logs relevant to their monitoring scope.

- **Compliance and Audit**: Organizations can selectively retain logs required for compliance, avoiding unnecessary data retention.

- **Custom Alerting and Analytics**: By ingesting only relevant logs, alert rules and analytics queries become more efficient and performant.

- **Multi-Tenant or Multi-Application Filtering**: In environments with multiple applications or tenants behind a firewall, logs can be filtered per tenant or application for targeted analysis.

---

### Important Considerations and Limitations

- **Rule Complexity**: While powerful, ingestion-time transformation rules require careful design to avoid accidentally filtering out critical logs.

- **Testing and Validation**: It is recommended to test transformation rules in a staging environment to ensure important data is not lost.

- **Latency**: Transformation happens at ingestion, so there is minimal impact on log availability, but complex rules might slightly increase ingestion latency.

- **Retention and Archival**: Since filtering happens before ingestion, filtered-out logs are not stored in Log Analytics and cannot be retrieved later.

- **Feature Availability**: This feature is
