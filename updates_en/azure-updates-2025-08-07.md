**Details**:

The recent Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) update introduces general availability support for Layer 7 (L7) network policies within Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS) clusters using Cilium, significantly enhancing network security and traffic management capabilities at the application layer.

**Background and Purpose**  
Traditionally, Kubernetes network policies operate primarily at Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP/UDP port) levels, which limits the granularity of traffic control to IP addresses and ports. However, modern microservices architectures often require more nuanced security controls based on application-layer protocols (HTTP, gRPC, etc.) to enforce policies such as URL path restrictions, HTTP methods, or header-based filtering. The introduction of L7 policies in AKS with ACNS and Cilium addresses this gap by enabling fine-grained, application-aware network security controls, improving both security posture and traffic governance.

**Specific Features and Detailed Changes**  
- **L7 Policy Enforcement:** Users can now define network policies that inspect and filter traffic based on application-layer metadata such as HTTP methods (GET, POST), URL paths, host headers, and gRPC methods.  
- **Integration with Cilium:** Cilium, an open-source eBPF-based networking and security solution, is leveraged to implement these L7 policies efficiently within the Linux kernel, providing high performance and low latency.  
- **Policy Specification:** Policies are expressed using Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that extend the standard network policy API to include L7 selectors and match criteria.  
- **Visibility and Observability:** Enhanced telemetry and logging features allow administrators to monitor L7 policy enforcement and traffic flows, aiding in troubleshooting and compliance auditing.

**Technical Mechanisms and Implementation Methods**  
The implementation relies on Cilium’s use of eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology, which allows dynamic insertion of code into the Linux kernel to perform deep packet inspection and filtering without the overhead of user-space proxies. This enables real-time L7 policy enforcement directly at the network interface level of pods. The policies are translated into eBPF programs that inspect packet payloads for HTTP/gRPC attributes, applying allow or deny decisions accordingly. The integration with AKS ensures that these policies can be managed declaratively via Kubernetes manifests and are compatible with existing Kubernetes RBAC and namespace isolation mechanisms.

**Use Cases and Application Scenarios**  
- **Microservices Security:** Enforce strict access controls between microservices by limiting allowed HTTP methods or paths, reducing attack surface and preventing unauthorized API calls.  
- **Compliance and Data Protection:** Implement policies that restrict sensitive data exposure by filtering traffic based on headers or request content patterns.  
- **Traffic Shaping and Routing:** Combine L7 policies with service mesh architectures to control traffic routing and apply security policies at ingress points.  
- **Multi-tenant Environments:** Provide tenant isolation by enforcing application-layer policies that prevent cross-tenant data leakage within shared clusters.

**Important Considerations and Limitations**  
- **Performance Impact:** While eBPF is efficient, enabling L7 inspection introduces additional CPU overhead compared to L3/L4 policies; careful performance testing is recommended for high-throughput workloads.  
- **Protocol Support:** Currently, L7 policies primarily support HTTP and gRPC protocols; other protocols may not be fully supported.  
- **Policy Complexity:** Defining and managing L7 policies requires understanding of application protocols and traffic patterns, increasing operational complexity.  
- **Compatibility:** This feature requires AKS clusters to use the Advanced Container Networking Services with Cilium; it is not available on clusters using the default Azure CNI or other networking plugins.

**Integration with Related Azure Services**  
- **Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics:** Enhanced observability of L7 policies can be integrated with Azure Monitor for centralized logging, alerting, and diagnostics.

### 8. Public Preview: Multiple Standard Load Balancers support in AKS

**Published**: August 06, 2025 03:30:15 UTC
**Link**: [Public Preview: Multiple Standard Load Balancers support in AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=499356)

**Update ID**: 499356
**Data source**: Azure Updates API

**Categories**: In preview, Compute, Containers, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Features

**Summary**:

- What was updated  
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) now supports multiple Standard Load Balancers (SLBs) per cluster, available in public preview.

- Key changes or new features  
This update enables AKS clusters to use more than one Standard Load Balancer simultaneously, overcoming the previous limit of 300 inbound rules per node NIC. It allows assigning different SLBs to separate agent pools, facilitating traffic isolation and improved scalability for large or complex workloads.

- Target audience affected  
Developers and IT professionals managing AKS clusters who require higher load balancing capacity, better traffic segmentation, or need to scale applications beyond the previous SLB rule limits.

- Important notes if any  
As this feature is in public preview, it should be used with caution in production environments. Users should test workloads thoroughly and monitor SLB configurations. Refer to official Azure documentation for configuration details and limitations during the preview phase.

**Details**:

The recent Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) update introduces public preview support for multiple Standard Load Balancers (SLBs) per AKS cluster, addressing key scalability and traffic isolation challenges inherent in single SLB deployments. Traditionally, AKS clusters were limited to one Standard Load Balancer per cluster, which imposed a maximum of 300 inbound NAT or load balancing rules per node network interface card (NIC). This constraint restricted large-scale or multi-tenant workloads that require extensive load balancing configurations or traffic segregation.

With this update, AKS enables assigning multiple SLBs to a single cluster, allowing each agent pool to be associated with a distinct Standard Load Balancer. This architectural enhancement effectively multiplies the available inbound rule capacity by distributing load balancing rules across multiple SLBs, thereby overcoming the 300-rule limit per NIC. It also facilitates logical traffic isolation, as different SLBs can be configured with unique frontend IPs, health probes, and load balancing rules tailored to the specific needs of each agent pool or workload type.

Technically, the implementation leverages Azure’s native Standard Load Balancer resource model, where each SLB is provisioned and managed independently but integrated into the AKS cluster’s networking fabric. During cluster or node pool creation and updates, users can specify which SLB to associate with each node pool. The AKS control plane orchestrates the provisioning and configuration of these SLBs, ensuring that Kubernetes services of type LoadBalancer are correctly mapped to the appropriate SLB based on node pool assignments. This requires enhancements in the AKS networking plugin and API server to support multi-SLB awareness and rule management.

Use cases benefiting from this feature include large-scale AKS deployments requiring thousands of inbound rules, multi-tenant clusters where workloads must be isolated at the network load balancer level, and scenarios demanding differentiated traffic routing policies per node pool. For example, a cluster hosting both production and development workloads can assign separate SLBs to each environment’s node pools, enabling independent scaling, monitoring, and security configurations. Additionally, this supports hybrid scenarios where different SLBs expose services on distinct public IPs or subnets, facilitating compliance and operational separation.

Important considerations include the preview nature of the feature, which may involve limitations or evolving API behaviors. Users must plan for increased management complexity due to multiple SLBs and ensure proper IP address management to avoid conflicts. The feature currently applies to Standard Load Balancers only, as Basic Load Balancers do not support this multi-instance model. Furthermore, integration with Azure Firewall, Application Gateway, or third-party network virtual appliances requires careful architecture to maintain consistent traffic flows and security postures across multiple SLBs.

Integration with related Azure services remains seamless, as each Standard Load Balancer functions as a first-class Azure resource compatible with Azure Monitor for metrics and diagnostics, Azure Policy for governance, and Azure Resource Manager templates for infrastructure as code. This update complements Azure’s broader networking enhancements in AKS, such as advanced networking (Azure CNI), user-defined routing, and private clusters, enabling more granular and scalable network architectures.

In summary, the public preview of multiple Standard Load Balancers per AKS cluster significantly enhances cluster scalability and traffic isolation by allowing distinct SLBs per node pool, overcoming previous inbound rule limits, and enabling sophisticated multi-tenant and large-scale deployment scenarios while maintaining deep integration with Azure’s networking ecosystem.

**Details**:

The Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Public Preview of LocalDNS introduces a node-local DNS proxy designed to optimize DNS resolution within AKS clusters, addressing performance bottlenecks and reliability issues inherent in large-scale Kubernetes deployments. Traditionally, AKS clusters rely on centralized DNS services (like CoreDNS) that can become overwhelmed under heavy query loads, leading to increased latency and potential resolution failures. LocalDNS mitigates these challenges by deploying a DNS proxy daemon on each node, enabling DNS queries to be resolved locally rather than routing all requests through a shared cluster DNS service.

Technically, LocalDNS operates by running a lightweight DNS proxy on every AKS node. This proxy intercepts DNS queries from pods on the node and either resolves them from a local cache or forwards them to the cluster DNS service if necessary. By caching DNS responses locally, LocalDNS significantly reduces the number of queries sent to the centralized DNS service, thereby lowering query latency and improving overall cluster DNS reliability. This architecture also reduces network hops and congestion, which is especially beneficial in large clusters with thousands of nodes and high DNS query volumes. The implementation leverages Kubernetes DaemonSets to ensure the DNS proxy runs on each node, integrating seamlessly with the existing CoreDNS service without requiring changes to pod configurations or application code.

From a feature perspective, LocalDNS provides:
- Node-local DNS caching and proxying to reduce latency.
- Improved DNS query throughput by offloading requests from the cluster DNS.
- Enhanced DNS reliability by minimizing single points of failure.
- Transparent integration with existing AKS DNS infrastructure.

Use cases for LocalDNS include large-scale AKS clusters where DNS query volume can cause performance degradation, latency-sensitive applications requiring faster DNS resolution, and scenarios where network reliability is critical. It is particularly useful in microservices architectures with frequent inter-service communication relying on DNS.

Important considerations include that LocalDNS is currently in public preview, so it should be used with caution in production environments. Users should monitor DNS performance and cluster behavior after enabling LocalDNS. Compatibility with custom DNS configurations and network policies should be validated, as LocalDNS modifies the DNS query path. Additionally, while LocalDNS reduces latency and load on CoreDNS, it introduces a new component on each node that requires resource allocation and monitoring.

Regarding integration, LocalDNS works alongside AKS’s existing CoreDNS service and leverages Kubernetes native constructs such as DaemonSets for deployment. It complements Azure networking features by reducing DNS-related network traffic, potentially improving overall cluster network efficiency. It also aligns with Azure Monitor and Azure Policy for observability and governance, allowing administrators to track DNS performance metrics and enforce configuration standards.

In summary, the LocalDNS public preview for AKS enhances DNS resolution by deploying a node-local DNS proxy that reduces latency, increases reliability, and alleviates load on centralized DNS services, making it a valuable update for optimizing DNS performance in large or latency-sensitive AKS clusters.

For more details, visit: https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=499313

**Details**:

The recent Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) update introduces generally available control plane improvements focused on enhancing the resiliency and efficiency of the Kubernetes API server, specifically through the implementation of Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) 5116, titled "Streaming Encoding for LIST Responses." This update addresses critical performance bottlenecks encountered during large LIST API calls, which are common in large-scale Kubernetes clusters.

**Background and Purpose**  
In Kubernetes, the API server acts as the central management entity, handling all RESTful API requests including LIST operations that retrieve collections of resources. In large clusters, LIST calls can return extensive datasets, causing significant memory consumption spikes on the API server. This can lead to degraded performance or instability in the control plane. KEP 5116 was introduced to optimize how LIST responses are encoded and transmitted, aiming to reduce memory usage and improve API server responsiveness and stability.

**Specific Features and Detailed Changes**  
The core feature of this update is the adoption of streaming encoding for LIST responses. Traditionally, the API server would marshal the entire list of resources into memory before sending the response to the client, resulting in high peak memory usage proportional to the size of the data set. With streaming encoding, the API server serializes and transmits the response incrementally, streaming chunks of the list as they are encoded rather than buffering the entire response in memory. This approach reduces peak memory usage by approximately 10x during large LIST calls, significantly lowering the risk of API server memory exhaustion.

**Technical Mechanisms and Implementation Methods**  
Streaming encoding leverages Kubernetes’ internal API machinery enhancements that allow the API server to write serialized objects directly to the HTTP response stream. This is implemented by modifying the encoding pipeline to support chunked transfer encoding, enabling the server to send partial data without waiting for the complete response to be ready. The API server’s LIST handlers were updated to iterate over resource items and encode them on-the-fly. This method also improves latency for clients, as data begins arriving sooner rather than after full serialization. The implementation adheres to Kubernetes API conventions and maintains backward compatibility with existing clients.

**Use Cases and Application Scenarios**  
This improvement is particularly beneficial for large-scale AKS clusters with thousands of nodes and tens of thousands of pods or other resources, where LIST operations are frequent and data volumes are substantial. Scenarios include cluster monitoring tools, custom controllers, and operators that perform LIST calls to reconcile state or gather metrics. It also benefits CI/CD pipelines and automation scripts that query cluster state extensively. By reducing API server memory pressure, cluster stability and responsiveness improve, enabling smoother operations and scaling.

**Important Considerations and Limitations**  
While streaming encoding reduces memory usage, it does not change the total data volume transmitted over the network. Network bandwidth and client-side processing remain factors to consider. Clients must support standard HTTP chunked transfer encoding, which is broadly supported but should be verified for custom tooling. Additionally, this update focuses on LIST responses; other API operations are unaffected. Monitoring and alerting on API server memory usage should continue to ensure that other factors do not cause resource exhaustion. The update is available by default in the latest AKS control plane versions, and no manual configuration is required.

**Integration with Related Azure Services**  
This control plane enhancement integrates seamlessly with Azure Monitor for containers, Azure Policy for Kubernetes, and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes, all of which rely heavily on LIST API calls for cluster state inspection. Improved API server performance directly benefits these services by reducing latency and increasing reliability of data collection and policy enforcement. Additionally, Azure DevOps pipelines and GitOps tools that interact with AKS clusters will experience more stable API interactions. This update complements other AKS control plane improvements aimed at scalability and operational excellence.

In summary, the GA release of streaming encoding for LIST responses in AKS control plane significantly optimizes API server memory usage during large LIST operations by implementing incremental response streaming per KEP 5116, enhancing cluster stability and performance in large-scale Kubernetes environments without
