For full details, visit: https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=498943

**Details**:

The late-July 2025 Azure SQL update introduces enhanced SQL language support by adding the UNISTR intrinsic function and enabling the ANSI SQL concatenation operator (||), aligning Azure SQL more closely with standard SQL syntax and improving Unicode string handling capabilities.

**Background and Purpose of the Update**  
Azure SQL continuously evolves to support broader SQL standards and developer preferences, improving compatibility and easing migration from other database platforms. Prior to this update, Azure SQL had limited native support for certain Unicode string literal definitions and used the plus sign (+) for string concatenation, which differs from the ANSI SQL standard. This update addresses these gaps by implementing the UNISTR function and the ANSI concatenation operator, thereby enhancing developer productivity and code portability.

**Specific Features and Detailed Changes**  
1. **UNISTR Intrinsic Function**:  
   The UNISTR function allows developers to define Unicode string literals using Unicode code points within a string, using the syntax UNISTR('...'). This function interprets escape sequences representing Unicode characters (e.g., \XXXX where XXXX is a hexadecimal Unicode code point), enabling precise and readable Unicode string definitions directly in SQL queries. This is particularly useful for representing characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane or special symbols without relying on external encoding or conversion.

2. **ANSI SQL Concatenation Operator (||)**:  
   Azure SQL now supports the double pipe (||) operator for string concatenation, which is the ANSI SQL standard. Previously, concatenation was primarily done using the plus sign (+), which can cause ambiguity with numeric addition and requires explicit type casting in some cases. Supporting (||) improves code clarity, reduces errors, and enhances compatibility with other ANSI-compliant SQL engines.

**Technical Mechanisms and Implementation Methods**  
- The UNISTR function is implemented as a built-in scalar function that parses the input string, interprets Unicode escape sequences, and returns the corresponding Unicode string. It integrates with the SQL parser and execution engine to handle Unicode literals at query compile time.  
- The (||) operator is added to the SQL parser’s grammar as a valid concatenation operator, mapped internally to the string concatenation function. It supports implicit type conversion for string-compatible data types, ensuring seamless concatenation behavior.

**Use Cases and Application Scenarios**  
- Applications requiring precise Unicode character representation, such as multilingual applications, internationalization scenarios, or processing of special symbols, benefit from UNISTR by embedding Unicode literals directly in SQL scripts.  
- Developers migrating from other ANSI-compliant databases (e.g., Oracle, PostgreSQL) can now use familiar concatenation syntax (||) without rewriting queries, simplifying migration and reducing code refactoring efforts.  
- Reporting and data transformation scripts that manipulate string data can leverage these features for cleaner, more maintainable code.

**Important Considerations and Limitations**  
- While UNISTR enhances Unicode support, developers should verify that the Unicode code points used are supported by the target collation and character set of the database to avoid unexpected results.  
- The (||) operator is now supported, but legacy code using (+) remains valid; however, mixing concatenation operators within the same query is not recommended to maintain readability.  
- Performance impact is minimal, but extensive use of UNISTR in large queries should be tested to ensure no parsing overhead affects execution times.  
- These features are available in Azure SQL Database and Managed Instance; compatibility with SQL Server on-premises depends on the version.

**Integration with Related Azure Services**  
- Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics pipelines that execute SQL scripts can leverage these features to standardize string handling and Unicode processing across data workflows.  
- Azure Logic Apps and Power Automate connectors interacting with Azure SQL can benefit from improved Unicode support in query expressions.  
- Applications using Azure App Service or Azure Functions with backend Azure SQL databases can write more portable and standard-compliant SQL code, facilitating cross-platform development.

In summary, the late-July 2025 Azure SQL update enhances Unicode

This feature is currently in Public Preview, so it should be used with caution in production environments. Users should monitor performance and replication lag and review Azure’s documentation for limitations and best practices when implementing cascading read replicas.

**Details**:

The recent Public Preview release of cascading read replicas for Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server introduces a significant enhancement in read scalability and replication topology flexibility. Previously, Azure Database for PostgreSQL allowed creation of read replicas directly from the primary server to offload read workloads, but this update enables the creation of additional read replicas from an existing read replica, forming a cascading replication chain.

**Background and Purpose**  
As cloud-native applications scale, read-heavy workloads often require multiple read replicas to distribute query load and improve performance. Traditional replication models in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server supported only a single hop from the primary server to read replicas, which could lead to increased load on the primary and network bottlenecks. The cascading read replica feature addresses these limitations by allowing a read replica itself to serve as a source for further read replicas, thereby distributing replication traffic and improving scalability and availability.

**Specific Features and Detailed Changes**  
- **Cascading Replication:** You can now create a read replica from an existing read replica rather than only from the primary server. This allows for multi-level replication topologies.

- **Flexible Server Support:** The feature is available for the flexible server deployment option, which provides more control over server configuration and maintenance windows compared to single server.  
- **Read-Only Replicas:** All replicas in the chain remain read-only, ensuring data consistency and integrity.  
- **Replication Lag Management:** The system manages replication lag across the cascading chain to maintain data freshness.

**Technical Mechanisms and Implementation Methods**  
Cascading read replicas leverage PostgreSQL’s native streaming replication capabilities, where WAL (Write-Ahead Log) data is streamed from the source server to the replica. In this update, the replication source can be either the primary or an existing read replica. Azure manages the replication endpoints, authentication, and failover configurations transparently. The replication chain is maintained by configuring the downstream replica’s recovery.conf (or equivalent in flexible server) to connect to the upstream replica’s replication endpoint. Azure’s platform automates the provisioning, monitoring, and failover processes to ensure replication health.

**Use Cases and Application Scenarios**  
- **Read Scalability:** Applications with high read throughput can distribute queries across multiple replicas without overloading the primary server.  
- **Geographically Distributed Reads:** Cascading replicas can be deployed closer to regional users, reducing latency by creating replicas in different Azure regions.  
- **Disaster Recovery and High Availability:** Multi-level replicas provide additional redundancy and can be used to quickly promote a replica to primary in case of failure.  
- **Analytics and Reporting:** Offload heavy analytical queries to downstream replicas without impacting transactional workloads on the primary.

**Important Considerations and Limitations**  
- **Replication Lag:** Each additional replication hop introduces potential lag; applications should be designed to tolerate eventual consistency on replicas further down the chain.  
- **Read-Only Restriction:** Replicas remain read-only; write operations must be directed to the primary server.  
- **Preview Status:** As a Public Preview feature, it may have limitations or lack SLA guarantees; production use should be carefully evaluated.  
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Users should implement monitoring for replication lag and health using Azure Monitor and PostgreSQL metrics.  
- **Compatibility:** This feature is currently supported only on flexible server deployments, not on single server or Hyperscale (Citus) deployments.

**Integration with Related Azure Services**  
- **Azure Monitor:** Enables tracking of replication health, lag, and server performance metrics.  
- **Azure Private Link and VNet Integration:** Cascading replicas can be deployed within virtual networks for secure, low-latency connectivity.  
- **Azure Backup:** Supports backup and restore operations on flexible servers with cascading replicas.  
- **Azure CLI and ARM Templates:** Provisioning and management of cascading replicas can
