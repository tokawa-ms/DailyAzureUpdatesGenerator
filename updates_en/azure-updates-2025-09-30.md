**Published**: September 29, 2025 15:30:44 UTC
**Link**: [Generally Available: Visualize New Azure Resource Manager Metrics through Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=506317)

**Update ID**: 506317
**Data source**: Azure Updates API

**Categories**: Launched, DevOps, Management and governance, Azure Monitor, Azure Resource Manager, Features, Management, Services

**Summary**:

- What was updated  
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) now provides enhanced integration with Azure Monitor Metrics, enabling improved visualization and monitoring of ARM operations at the subscription level.

- Key changes or new features  
Developers and IT professionals can access new, granular metrics related to ARM activities such as deployment operations, resource provisioning, and management actions directly through Azure Monitor. This allows for deeper insights into the health and performance of resource management processes. Metrics can be visualized in dashboards, queried via APIs, and used to configure alerts for proactive issue detection.

- Target audience affected  
This update primarily benefits cloud administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers who manage and monitor Azure resources and deployments at scale. It supports improved operational visibility and troubleshooting capabilities for subscription-level resource management.

- Important notes if any  
To leverage these new metrics, users should ensure their Azure Monitor setup includes the latest ARM metrics namespace. Integration with existing monitoring workflows and automation scripts can enhance incident response and operational efficiency. No additional cost is mentioned, but users should verify metric retention and ingestion policies.

**Details**:

The recent update announces the general availability of enhanced Azure Resource Manager (ARM) metrics integration within Azure Monitor Metrics, enabling IT professionals to gain deeper operational insights and more granular monitoring of their Azure subscriptions’ resource management activities. This enhancement addresses the need for improved observability into ARM operations, which are critical for managing and automating Azure resources at scale.

**Background and Purpose**  
Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure, orchestrating resource provisioning, updates, and deletions. While Azure Monitor has long provided telemetry and metrics for resources themselves, visibility into the ARM service’s internal operations—such as deployment success rates, request latencies, and throttling events—was limited. This update aims to fill that gap by exposing ARM-specific operational metrics directly in Azure Monitor Metrics, allowing administrators and DevOps teams to monitor the health and performance of their resource management workflows in real time.

**Specific Features and Detailed Changes**  
- **New ARM Metrics Availability:** Users can now access a set of predefined metrics related to ARM operations, including deployment counts, request latencies, failure rates, and throttling occurrences, segmented by subscription and resource provider.  
- **Granular Filtering and Aggregation:** Metrics can be filtered by operation type (e.g., create, update, delete), status codes, and resource providers, enabling detailed analysis of specific ARM activities.  
- **Integration with Azure Monitor Metrics Explorer:** These ARM metrics are fully integrated into the Metrics Explorer UI, allowing users to create custom charts, dashboards, and alerts based on ARM operational data.  
- **API and CLI Access:** Metrics are accessible programmatically via Azure Monitor REST APIs and Azure CLI, facilitating automation and integration into existing monitoring pipelines.

**Technical Mechanisms and Implementation Methods**  
Under the hood, ARM emits telemetry data about each management operation it processes. This telemetry is now routed to Azure Monitor Metrics, which stores the data in a time-series database optimized for high-throughput metric ingestion and querying. The metrics are exposed using the standard Azure Monitor metrics namespace and schema, ensuring compatibility with existing monitoring tools. Azure Monitor’s metric aggregation engine supports dimensional breakdowns, allowing metrics to be sliced by operation name, status, and resource provider. This implementation leverages ARM’s native telemetry hooks combined with Azure Monitor’s scalable ingestion and querying infrastructure.

**Use Cases and Application Scenarios**  
- **Operational Health Monitoring:** DevOps teams can track deployment success rates and failure trends to proactively identify issues in infrastructure-as-code pipelines or manual deployments.  
- **Performance Analysis:** By monitoring request latencies and throttling events, teams can detect performance bottlenecks or capacity limits in ARM, enabling optimization of deployment strategies.  
- **Alerting and Automation:** Custom alerts can be configured on ARM metrics to notify teams of abnormal failure spikes or throttling, triggering automated remediation workflows or escalations.  
- **Capacity Planning:** Historical ARM metrics data supports capacity planning and scaling decisions for subscription-level resource management activities.

**Important Considerations and Limitations**  
- **Metric Latency:** As with most Azure Monitor metrics, there may be a slight delay (typically a few minutes) between ARM operation occurrence and metric availability.  
- **Metric Retention:** Metrics retention policies apply as per Azure Monitor defaults (typically 93 days), so long-term historical analysis requires exporting data to external storage or Log Analytics.  
- **Scope:** Metrics are scoped at the subscription level and segmented by resource provider but do not provide per-resource granularity for ARM operations.  
- **Permissions:** Accessing ARM metrics requires appropriate Azure RBAC permissions on the subscription to ensure secure telemetry access.

**Integration with Related Azure Services**  
- **Azure Monitor Dashboards:** ARM metrics can be incorporated into custom dashboards alongside other resource metrics for unified monitoring views.  
- **Azure Alerts:** Integration with Azure Alerts enables proactive incident management based on ARM operational thresholds.  
- **Azure Log Analytics:** While ARM metrics are exposed in Azure Monitor Metrics, complementary ARM activity logs continue
