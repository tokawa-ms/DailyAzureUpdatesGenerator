**Details**:

The recent general availability of Virtual Network (VNet) Encryption for Azure Managed Lustre marks a significant enhancement in securing data in transit between Azure Managed Lustre file systems and client virtual machines (VMs). This update addresses critical compliance and security requirements by ensuring that all network traffic within the Azure backbone is encrypted, thereby protecting sensitive data from interception or tampering during transmission.

**Background and Purpose**  
Azure Managed Lustre is a high-performance, scalable file system optimized for compute-intensive workloads such as HPC, AI, and big data analytics. As organizations increasingly adopt cloud-based storage solutions, regulatory standards and internal security policies demand robust encryption mechanisms not only at rest but also in transit. Prior to this update, data moving between client VMs and Managed Lustre was transmitted over the Azure virtual network without encryption, potentially exposing data to risks within the network fabric. The introduction of VNet Encryption aims to close this gap by providing native encryption of data packets traveling over the virtual network, thereby enhancing data confidentiality and compliance posture.

**Specific Features and Detailed Changes**  
- **In-transit Data Encryption:** All data exchanged between Azure Managed Lustre and client VMs within the same VNet or peered VNets is now encrypted using industry-standard protocols.  
- **Seamless Enablement:** VNet Encryption can be enabled via configuration settings during the creation of a Managed Lustre file system or applied to existing deployments with minimal disruption.  
- **Compliance Alignment:** This feature supports compliance with standards such as HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI DSS that mandate encryption of data in transit.  
- **No Performance Degradation:** Azure has optimized the encryption process to minimize latency and throughput impact, preserving the high-performance characteristics of Lustre.

**Technical Mechanisms and Implementation Methods**  
The encryption leverages Azure’s underlying virtual network infrastructure, employing IPsec or similar cryptographic protocols to secure packets at the network layer. When VNet Encryption is enabled, all network traffic between the Managed Lustre endpoint and client VMs is encapsulated and encrypted before transmission over the Azure backbone. This is transparent to the client applications and requires no changes to the Lustre protocol or client-side software. The encryption keys are managed by Azure’s Key Vault and security infrastructure, ensuring secure key lifecycle management and rotation without user intervention.

**Use Cases and Application Scenarios**  
- **Regulated Industries:** Healthcare, finance, and government organizations can now confidently use Azure Managed Lustre for sensitive workloads involving personal data or financial records.  
- **Multi-tenant Environments:** Enterprises running multiple workloads in isolated VNets can enforce encryption to prevent lateral data exposure.  
- **Hybrid Architectures:** Customers integrating on-premises HPC clusters with Azure Managed Lustre via VPN or ExpressRoute can extend encryption policies consistently across environments.  
- **AI and Big Data Analytics:** Securely processing large datasets in transit without compromising performance is critical for AI model training and analytics pipelines.

**Important Considerations and Limitations**  
- **Scope of Encryption:** VNet Encryption applies only to data in transit within the Azure virtual network between Managed Lustre and client VMs; it does not cover data in transit outside Azure or at the application layer.  
- **Compatibility:** Ensure that client VMs and network configurations support encrypted traffic without firewall or NSG rules blocking IPsec or related protocols.  
- **Performance Monitoring:** Although optimized, workloads with extremely low latency requirements should validate performance impact in their specific scenarios.  
- **Cost Implications:** There may be minor cost implications related to encryption processing and key management services.

**Integration with Related Azure Services**  
- **Azure Virtual Network:** Leverages VNet infrastructure for secure traffic routing and encryption.  
- **Azure Key Vault:** Manages cryptographic keys used for encryption, ensuring secure key storage and rotation.  
- **Azure Monitor and Network Watcher:** Can be used to monitor network traffic and diagnose connectivity or encryption-related issues.  
- **Azure Policy:** Organizations can enforce policies to

**Link**: [Generally Available: Search Job Enhancements in Log Analytics ](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=498462)

**Update ID**: 498462
**Data source**: Azure Updates API

**Categories**: Launched, DevOps, Management and governance, Azure Monitor, Features

**Summary**:

- What was updated  
Azure Log Analytics introduced generally available enhancements to Search Jobs, enabling asynchronous queries over any data in a Log Analytics workspace, including long-term retention data.

- Key changes or new features  
Search Jobs now support running queries asynchronously on all workspace data, not limited to recent data, allowing retrieval of historical logs from long-term retention. The results of these queries are stored in a new Analytics table within the workspace, making them accessible for subsequent queries and analysis. This improves efficiency by decoupling query execution from result consumption and enables complex workflows involving large datasets over extended time periods.

- Target audience affected  
Developers and IT professionals who use Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for querying, monitoring, and analyzing log data, especially those requiring access to historical data and advanced query orchestration.

- Important notes if any

**Details**:

The recent general availability of Search Job enhancements in Azure Log Analytics introduces a powerful asynchronous querying capability that significantly extends the flexibility and scope of data analysis within Log Analytics workspaces. This update enables IT professionals to run Search Jobs on any data stored in their workspace, including data retained in long-term retention, and to surface the results as a new Analytics table for subsequent queries, thereby streamlining complex investigative workflows and long-term data analysis.

**Background and Purpose**  
Traditionally, querying large volumes of telemetry and log data in Log Analytics, especially data archived in long-term retention, posed challenges due to latency and limited query scope. Search Jobs were introduced to address these limitations by allowing asynchronous execution of queries that can span all data in the workspace, including historical data beyond the standard retention period. This update marks the general availability of enhanced Search Jobs, reflecting maturity and expanded capabilities to support enterprise-grade operational analytics and security investigations.

**Specific Features and Detailed Changes**  
- **Asynchronous Query Execution:** Search Jobs run asynchronously, enabling users to submit complex queries without waiting for immediate results, which is critical for large datasets or long-term retention data.  
- **Support for Long-Term Retention Data:** Queries can now access data stored in the long-term retention tier, which was previously difficult to query efficiently, allowing comprehensive historical analysis.  
- **Results Materialized as Analytics Tables:** The output of a Search Job is persisted as a new Analytics table within the workspace, making it accessible for further Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries, dashboards, or alerts.  
- **Improved Query Management:** Users can track the status of Search Jobs, retrieve results upon completion, and manage job lifecycle programmatically or via the Azure portal.  
- **Integration with KQL:** The results table can be queried using standard KQL, enabling seamless integration with existing query workflows and tools.

**Technical Mechanisms and Implementation Methods**  
Search Jobs leverage the underlying Kusto engine’s asynchronous processing capabilities. When a Search Job is initiated, the query is dispatched to run in the background against both the hot data store and the long-term retention store. Once the job completes, the results are persisted as a new table in the workspace’s schema. This persistence allows subsequent queries to treat the Search Job output as a first-class data source. The system provides APIs and portal interfaces to submit jobs, monitor progress, and retrieve results, supporting automation and integration into CI/CD pipelines or monitoring solutions.

**Use Cases and Application Scenarios**
