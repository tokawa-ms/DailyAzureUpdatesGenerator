Azure Firewall now supports ingestion-time transformation of logs within Azure Log Analytics.

- Key changes or new features  
This update enables selective logging and advanced filtering of firewall logs at ingestion time.

This capability helps optimize log ingestion costs and storage by preventing unnecessary data from being ingested and stored.

- Target audience affected  
Developers, security engineers, and IT professionals who rely on Azure Firewall logs for monitoring, security analysis, and compliance. Organizations using Log Analytics for firewall log analysis will benefit from improved cost management and more efficient log data handling.

- Important notes if any
