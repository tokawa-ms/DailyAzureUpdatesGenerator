### 1. Generally Available: Private Application Gateway on Azure Application Gateway v2

**Published**: August 08, 2025 17:00:36 UTC
**Link**: [Generally Available: Private Application Gateway on Azure Application Gateway v2](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=500225)

**Update ID**: 500225
**Data source**: Azure Updates API

**Categories**: Launched, Networking, Security, Application Gateway, Services, Features

**Summary**:

- What was updated  
Azure Application Gateway v2 now generally supports Private Application Gateway, introducing enhanced network exposure controls.

- Key changes or new features  
Private Application Gateway enables deployment of Application Gateway v2 within a virtual network with private IP addresses only, eliminating public internet exposure. This improves security by restricting access to internal networks. It supports full feature parity with Application Gateway v2, including autoscaling, zone redundancy, and Web Application Firewall (WAF). Developers and IT professionals can now configure Application Gateway to serve internal applications securely without public endpoints.

- Target audience affected  
Developers, network architects, and IT professionals managing secure, scalable web application delivery and internal-facing applications on Azure.

- Important notes if any  
Private Application Gateway requires deployment in a subnet within a virtual network and supports integration with Azure Private Link and internal load balancing scenarios. This update is GA, meaning production-ready with full Azure support. Users should review network design to leverage private IP addressing and ensure proper DNS and routing configurations for internal access.

**Details**:

The Azure Application Gateway v2 SKU has reached general availability for its Private Application Gateway feature, introducing enhanced capabilities that allow IT professionals to deploy Application Gateway instances with private network exposure, thereby improving security and control over inbound traffic.

**Background and Purpose:**  
Azure Application Gateway is a Layer 7 load balancer designed for web traffic, providing features such as SSL termination, URL-based routing, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) integration. Traditionally, Application Gateway instances are publicly accessible, which may not align with strict security or compliance requirements in certain enterprise environments. The Private Application Gateway update addresses this by enabling deployment of Application Gateway v2 instances entirely within a private virtual network (VNet), eliminating public IP exposure and reducing attack surface.

**Specific Features and Changes:**  
- **Private IP Addressing:** Application Gateway v2 can now be deployed with only private IP addresses within a subnet of a customer VNet, removing the need for public IP addresses.  
- **No Public Endpoint:** The gateway does not expose a public frontend IP, ensuring all inbound traffic must traverse private network paths such as VPN, ExpressRoute, or Azure Bastion.  
- **Enhanced Network Control:** Customers gain granular control over network traffic flow, leveraging NSGs (Network Security Groups) and UDRs (User Defined Routes) to restrict or monitor traffic to the gateway.  
- **Compatibility with WAF v2:** The private deployment supports Web Application Firewall capabilities, maintaining security protections for web applications without public exposure.  
- **Integration with Private Link and Private DNS:** The feature supports integration with Azure Private Link and Private DNS zones, enabling secure and seamless name resolution and connectivity within private networks.

**Technical Mechanisms and Implementation:**  
To implement a Private Application Gateway, the gateway is deployed into a dedicated subnet within a VNet with only private IPs assigned. The frontend configuration omits public IPs, and routing is configured to direct traffic internally. Access to the gateway is typically enabled via VPN or ExpressRoute connections to the VNet, or from other Azure resources within the same or peered VNets. NSGs can be applied to the gateway subnet to restrict inbound and outbound traffic. DNS resolution for the private IP frontend can be managed via Azure Private DNS zones or custom DNS servers to ensure clients can resolve the gatewayâ€™s private endpoint.

**Use Cases and Application Scenarios:**  
- **Internal Web Applications:** Hosting intranet or internal-facing web applications that require load balancing and WAF protection without public internet exposure.  
- **Hybrid Connectivity:** Enterprises with hybrid cloud architectures can route on-premises traffic securely to internal web applications via VPN or ExpressRoute through the private gateway.  
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Organizations with strict compliance requirements (e.g., financial, healthcare) benefit from eliminating public endpoints to reduce attack surfaces.  
- **Multi-tier Architectures:** Application Gateway can be used as an internal load balancer in multi-tier applications, controlling traffic between front-end and back-end services within VNets.

**Important Considerations and Limitations:**  
- **No Public Access:** Since the gateway has no public IP, all clients must have network access to the VNet, which may require additional network configuration.  
- **Subnet Requirements:** The gateway requires a dedicated subnet with sufficient IP addresses; subnet size planning is critical.  
- **DNS Configuration:** Proper DNS setup is essential to resolve the private IP addresses of the gateway frontend.  
- **Monitoring and Diagnostics:** Standard Application Gateway monitoring and diagnostics apply, but network monitoring should also include VNet and NSG logs to troubleshoot connectivity.  
- **Scaling and Availability:** The scaling and availability features of Application Gateway v2 remain consistent; however, network design must ensure redundancy and failover paths within the private network.

**Integration with Related Azure Services:**  
- **Azure Private Link:** Enables secure, private connectivity to the Application Gateway from other Azure services or on-premises networks.  
- **Azure Firewall and NSGs:** Can be used alongside the
