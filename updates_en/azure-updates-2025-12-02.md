**Categories**: Launched

**Summary**:

- What was updated  
Microsoft has announced the general availability of the Perth Azure Extended Zone.

- Key changes or new features  
Azure Extended Zones are localized, small-footprint Azure datacenter extensions deployed in metro areas or specific jurisdictions. They enable customers to run latency-sensitive and data residency-bound workloads closer to end users or regulated environments. The Perth Extended Zone provides Azure services with low latency and compliance benefits within the Perth metro area, enhancing performance and data sovereignty for regional customers.

- Target audience affected  
This update primarily benefits developers and IT professionals managing applications requiring low latency access or strict data residency compliance in Western Australia. Enterprises in regulated industries or with distributed architectures in the Perth region will find this especially relevant.

- Important notes if any  
Azure Extended Zones complement existing Azure regions and availability zones but are designed for specific locality needs rather than broad regional coverage. Customers should evaluate workload placement to leverage the Perth Extended Zone for optimal latency and compliance. Further details and service availability can be found on the official Azure updates page.
